##**Matplotlib Practice:**

I used matplotlib to create marketing charts based on website data. I have the website data in a csv file, which I load and then plot.

**marketing_analytics.csv - the number of website visitors by month**


**q4_revenue.csv - the total revenue breakdown between subscriptions and marketing campaigns**


**top_channels.csv - Top channels that website visitors use to get to your website**


**top_sources.csv - Top sources that website visitors use to get to your website**
